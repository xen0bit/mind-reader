A dumb idea performed with significant effort is not a dumb idea if it produces interesting results

I recorded EEG data from a bluetooth meditation headset and built a setup to display one word at a time on the screen from harry potter to label and train a ML classifier in an attempt to read minds in near-real time.

Did it work? Nope. But I had the means to try something cool so I pursued it.

But hey! I got my brainwaves on Github, so I got that going for me which is nice: https://github.com/xen0bit/mind-reader/blob/main/EEG_recording.csv
